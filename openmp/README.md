# Part 1 - Serial implementation

Write a serial implementation of the algorithm in C or C++. Name the source file of this implementation tsp.c. As stated, your program should expect two input parameters.
Make sure to include a Makefile, the simple command

`$ make`

Should generate an executable with the same name as the source file (minus the extension). Also, to
be uniform across groups, in this makefile please use the gcc compiler with optimization flag -O3.
This version will serve as your base for comparisons and must be as efficient as possible.
